# Food Ordering System

## Introduction

In alignment with the Singapore governmentâ€™s push for digitalization in the service industry, an established restaurant chain is commissioning the development of a food ordering system for its restaurants. The system aims to provide a convenient and efficient way for customers to browse available food selections, place orders, and track order status. Additionally, the system will enable restaurants to efficiently process orders, manage customer profiles, and enhance customer experience through a loyalty points system. The system will also generate useful reports to help the restaurant chain improve its food offerings and services.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to implement a food ordering system using C++. The system will allow users to register, log in, browse food selections, create new orders, and cancel orders (only if not yet prepared). Admin users will have additional functionalities such as viewing incoming orders, updating order statuses, and accessing customer information for each order.
